1. Overview: Ecommerce website where it can be easily customizable to any business.  You can add your personal business information, images of your items for sale and pricing with a shopping cart and credit card acceptance.  Will also utilize APIs to pull in local publicly available (Google maps, blogs, weather, etc.)
2. Features: 
User login
Email confirmation
Form submission for amenities, rating, review, other product details
Search database by product or features
Exact address validation via autocomplete (using Google Maps)?
3. Technologies:
Java
Spring Boot
MySQL
JavaScript
4. What I’ll have to learn: I will have to learn how/whether I can integrate my existing Python-based login/form-submission website (which I built during Unit 2) with JavaScript and AJAX. I will have to learn how to use data from several APIs (with any luck), in order to integrate a useful user experience. I also plan on using this project as a way to learn to use React. I hope this isn’t too disjointed or over-ambitious ?
